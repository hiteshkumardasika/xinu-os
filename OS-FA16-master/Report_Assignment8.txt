Assignment-8

Problem -1:
Implementing chat application in xinu which can communicate with a chat app running in Linux on a port.

running the program in linux

filename: server.c
It runs on the port 3000

In xinu:
chats <ipaddress> <port>


filenames:
xsh_chats.c
server.c

problem -2:
Adding a new implementation to ARP which clears the cache after every 5 minutes.

files changed:

arp.h
Add a new field in arpentry called timestamp which stores the timestamp value

arp.c
add a new function called arp_cache_clear() which checks the arp cache table and
clears stale entries by checking if the timestamp is greater than 5 minutes.
every time the entry is resloved, timestamp is updated.



problem -3: Network Futures
Futures were already implemented.we tried to use the same implementation.
The flow is as follows:
1. chats application in xinu initiates the communication by sending a text.
2.the server app running in linux sends back the length of the text and we consider
  it as producer and store its value in the future object
3. there is future consumer which will consume this value. Ideally chats application
  itself is a producer here.

  Files changed or added:
  xsh_chats.c
  future_netw_cons.c
  future.h
