1.It outputs garbage i.e output is not properly printed. it is because context switching of the process is not properly
happening.
As there is a printf statement included in both producer and consumer and as printf requires io the output is not proper

2.No. Not all the produced values are being consumed. Consumer is starting only when the producer has completed its task
and hence not all values are properly getting consumed.

Functions:
produce()
    produces item. it puts a fresh value into the global variable 'n' for every iteration

consume()
    consumes item. it reads the global variable 'n' value.

create()
    used to create a process in xinu. it takes 6 arguments.They are name of the function,stack size required for that
    function,priority,alias name for the process to be shown in the process table,count of arguments given to the function
    and arguments. create returns pid32

resume()
    used to move a process into ready queue. takes pid as input.
    and hence not all values are properly getting consumed.
